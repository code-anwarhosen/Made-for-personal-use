or in CMD in Windows.

It's easy to use. You just need to run the script and 
then input the parameter in Integer or in Float point
number like (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) these number. Each number 
represent as hour. You can also input float number like 
0.01 = 35 seconds

0.1 = 6 minutes 
0.5 = 30 minutes
